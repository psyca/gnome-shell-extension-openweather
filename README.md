*gnome-shell-extension-openweather* is a simple extension for displaying weather conditions and forecasts in GNOME Shell, featuring support for multiple locations, no need for WOEID, a symmetrical layout and a settings panel through *gnome-shell-extension-prefs*.

Currently, the weather data, including forecasts for up to ten days, is fetched from [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/).

# Installation

After the installation, restart GNOME Shell (`Alt`+`F2`, `r`, `Enter`) and enable the extension through *gnome-tweak-tool*.

## Through extensions.gnome.org (Local installation)

Go on the [OpenWeather](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/750/openweather/) extension page on extensions.gnome.org, click on the switch ("OFF" => "ON"), click on the install button. That's it !

## Through a package manager

#### Note: you need the root password for all these installation modes, if you do not have root-access, and the needed build-dependencies are installed, use the generic install.

### [Debian](http://packages.debian.org/source/unstable/gnome-shell-extension-weather)

Debian uses the (former master now ) yahoo-branch !

My fork of the extension is currently only available for unstable/sid.

Install the package through APT (or use your favourite package-manager, e.g. synaptic):

	sudo apt-get install gnome-shell-extension-weather


### [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/)

You can install the extension from [my repo](http://rpm.jenslody.de/).
I have packages for Fedora 18, 19 and 20.

To install my repo download and install [this rpm](http://rpm.jenslody.de/fedora-jenslody.de-0.1-2.fc17.noarch.rpm).

If it is not installed automatically, just run:

    sudo yum localinstall --nogpgcheck http://rpm.jenslody.de/fedora-jenslody.de-0.1-2.fc17.noarch.rpm

Now you can install the extension, either via your favourite package-manager or on a console:

    sudo yum install gnome-shell-extension-openweather


## Generic (Local installation)

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
* *dconf*,
* *gettext*,
* *pkg-config*,
* *git*,
* *glib2 (and development packages)*,
* *zip*,
* *gnome-common*,
* *autoconf*,
* *automake*,
* *intltool*.
* *gnome-tweak-tool*.

Run the following commands:

	cd ~ && git clone git://github.com/jenslody/gnome-shell-extension-openweather.git
	cd ~/gnome-shell-extension-weather
	./autogen.sh && make local-install

----

# Configuration

Launch *gnome-shell-extension-prefs* (reachable also through the *OpenWeather Settings* button on the extension popup) and select *OpenWeather* from the drop-down menu to edit the configuration.

You can also use *dconf-editor* or *gsettings* to configure the extension through the command line.

If you switch from old openweathermap to the new master ( or openweathermap), you can load the settings with

    dconf dump /org/gnome/shell/extensions/weather/ | dconf load /org/gnome/shell/extensions/openweather/

This can also work for most locations, if you switch from old yahoo-based master-branch (now yahoo) to the new master-branch (openweathermap-based).

The [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/) maintainers recommend to use an [API key](http://openweathermap.org/appid). This key can be added in the preferences dialog.
